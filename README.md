# Vehicle-Influx-Detection-System
ehicle  influx  is  a  major  problem  in  the  world due  to  the  increase  in  the  number  of  vehicles.  At  present  traffic  control  is  done  via  feature-based  methods  or  via traditional methods which are inefficient and consume a lot of time. To control the traffic here we are using computer vision-based  algorithms  using  Open  CV  [1]  and  machine  learning algorithm  Haarcascade[2],  which  is  comparatively  easier and faster. “Time  is  Money”,  our  main  focus  was  to  save  peoples’  time by  reducing  the  heavy  congestion  of  traffic.  Through  this research  paper,  we  tried  to  give  an  idea  to  control  the traffic efficiently.
